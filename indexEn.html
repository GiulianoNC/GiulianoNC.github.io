            On this site, you can find various applications — from tools for approving orders 
            integrated with the Orchestrator, to apps that use internal databases (SQLite), 
            QR code scanning, and integration with handheld devices for barcode reading.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the development of these apps, I have mainly used <strong>Java</strong> along with 
            libraries such as <strong>Retrofit2</strong> and <strong>HTTP</strong>. 
            In addition, I developed my first app published on the App Store using 
            <strong>Flutter</strong> and the <strong>Dart</strong> language.
          </p>

          <p>
            I began my career as a junior consultant, participating in small developments, 
            and later transitioned into the <strong>Mobile Development</strong> area.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also take part in the development of new objects, standard modifications, 
            localizations, and Plug & Play solutions, as well as in implementations, migrations, 
            upgrades, and customization of migrated objects. 
            I have experience in problem analysis, documentation, and function modifications (NER and C), 
            API, and BI Publisher.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have worked with technical and functional teams distributed across different countries. 
            I am certified in <strong>Scrum Foundations</strong> and <strong>Project Management</strong> 
            (Initiation and Planning).
          </p>

          <p>
            I also have experience as a consultant in management systems and have participated in various 
            international projects. 
            I work as a web and desktop application developer, 
            as well as an instructor of SQL from basic to intermediate levels.
          </p>

          <p>
            I completed a <strong>Java Full Stack</strong> certification, which allows me to work 
            on both the <em>back-end</em> and <em>front-end</em>. 
            I have also participated in several JD Edwards upgrade projects 
            for different clients and versions.

                This is a project I was assigned and worked on recently.  
                The main objective was to develop a functional and efficient mobile application.

                📋 **Client List**: Creation of a dynamic list with a search bar that displays results in batches of 5 clients.  
                
                🔄 **Client Management (CRUD)**: Implementation of features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting clients.  
                
                🔑 **Login Screen**: Integration with an API to retrieve the authentication token required to consume client-related APIs.  
                
                🎨 **Figma Design**: Implementation of screens that adhere to the provided design specifications.

            <!-- Replace the below paragraph with info about yourself -->
            <p>
                I am a passionate mobile application developer
              with over three years of experience at Quantum Consulting,
              focusing on both online and offline environments integrated with the AIS server of the Oracle JD Edwards EO system.

              I am involved in the development of:
              • New objects such as standard modifications, localizations, and Plug and Play components.
              • Implementations.
              • Migrations and upgrades.
              • Customization of migrated objects.
              • Problem analysis and documentation.
              • Modification of functions (NER and C), APIs, BI, etc.

              I have experience working with different technical and functional teams located in various countries.
              I am certified in Scrum Foundations, Project Initiation, and Project Planning.
              I have experience in management systems, working as a consultant and participating in multiple projects across different countries.
              I have also developed interactive applications and taught SQL from basic to intermediate levels.

              I have knowledge and studies in system development for web and desktop environments, and in various technologies.
              I completed a Java Full Stack certification, which allows me to work on both the back-end and front-end sides of development.
              I have participated in several upgrade projects for different clients and JD Edwards versions.

              During this time, I have worked on a wide range of projects—
              from applications for order approval integrated with the Orchestrator,
              to apps using internal databases (SQLite) integrated with handheld devices
              for barcode reading and QR code scanning.

              For these applications, I mainly used Java and various frameworks, employing Retrofit and OkHttp
              for efficient handling of HTTP requests.
              I also took on and successfully met the challenge of launching my first app on the App Store (iOS),
              where I used Flutter and the Dart language for development,
              demonstrating adaptability and strong technical skills.

              I successfully supervised a cross-functional team
              composed of a front-end developer and a graphic designer,
              leading the execution of key projects.
              My responsibilities included not only managing daily tasks,
              but also fostering a collaborative environment where the developer and designer
              could maximize their skills and creativity.

              As a professional goal, I aim to advance toward the role of Senior Mobile Developer,
              aspiring to fully master multiple platforms
              and specialize in Java, Flutter, and Swift.
              I am committed to continuous growth, learning, and refinement of my technical abilities
              to contribute meaningfully to the development of innovative and high-quality applications.            </p>
